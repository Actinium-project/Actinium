  o Minor bugfixes (hidden service v3):
    - Don't warn so loudly when tor is unable to decode a descriptor. This can
      now happen as a normal use case if a client gets a descriptor with
      client authorization but the client is not authorized. Fixes bug 27550;
      bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha.
