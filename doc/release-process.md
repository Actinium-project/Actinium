Release Process
====================

Before every release candidate:

* Update translations (ping wumpus on IRC) see [translation_process.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md#synchronising-translations).

<<<<<<< HEAD
* Update manpages, see [gen-manpages.sh](https://github.com/Actinium-project/Actinium/blob/master/contrib/devtools/README.md#gen-manpagessh).
=======
* Update manpages, see [gen-manpages.sh](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin/blob/master/contrib/devtools/README.md#gen-manpagessh).
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16

Before every minor and major release:

* Update [bips.md](bips.md) to account for changes since the last release.
* Update version in `configure.ac` (don't forget to set `CLIENT_VERSION_IS_RELEASE` to `true`)
* Write release notes (see below)
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` nMinimumChainWork with information from the getblockchaininfo rpc.
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` defaultAssumeValid  with information from the getblockhash rpc.
  - The selected value must not be orphaned so it may be useful to set the value two blocks back from the tip.
  - Testnet should be set some tens of thousands back from the tip due to reorgs there.
  - This update should be reviewed with a reindex-chainstate with assumevalid=0 to catch any defect
     that causes rejection of blocks in the past history.

Before every major release:

* Update hardcoded [seeds](/contrib/seeds/README.md), see [this pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7415) for an example.
* Update [`BLOCK_CHAIN_SIZE`](/src/qt/intro.cpp) to the current size plus some overhead.
* Update `src/chainparams.cpp` chainTxData with statistics about the transaction count and rate.
* Update version of `contrib/gitian-descriptors/*.yml`: usually one'd want to do this on master after branching off the release - but be sure to at least do it before a new major release

### First time / New builders

If you're using the automated script (found in [contrib/gitian-build.sh](/contrib/gitian-build.sh)), then at this point you should run it with the "--setup" command. Otherwise ignore this.

Check out the source code in the following directory hierarchy.

    cd /path/to/your/toplevel/build
<<<<<<< HEAD
    git clone https://github.com/Actinium-project/gitian.sigs.ltc.git
    git clone https://github.com/Actinium-project/Actinium-detached-sigs.git
    git clone https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git
    git clone https://github.com/Actinium-project/Actinium.git

### Actinium maintainers/release engineers, suggestion for writing release notes
=======
    git clone https://github.com/litecoin-project/gitian.sigs.ltc.git
    git clone https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin-detached-sigs.git
    git clone https://github.com/devrandom/gitian-builder.git
    git clone https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin.git

### Litecoin maintainers/release engineers, suggestion for writing release notes
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16

Write release notes. git shortlog helps a lot, for example:

    git shortlog --no-merges v(current version, e.g. 0.7.2)..v(new version, e.g. 0.8.0)

(or ping @wumpus on IRC, he has specific tooling to generate the list of merged pulls
and sort them into categories based on labels)

Generate list of authors:

    git log --format='%aN' "$*" | sort -ui | sed -e 's/^/- /'

Tag version (or release candidate) in git

    git tag -s v(new version, e.g. 0.8.0)

### Setup and perform Gitian builds

If you're using the automated script (found in [contrib/gitian-build.sh](/contrib/gitian-build.sh)), then at this point you should run it with the "--build" command. Otherwise ignore this.

Setup Gitian descriptors:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    pushd ./Actinium
=======
    pushd ./litecoin
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16
    export SIGNER=(your Gitian key, ie bluematt, sipa, etc)
    export VERSION=(new version, e.g. 0.8.0)
    git fetch
    git checkout v${VERSION}
    popd

Ensure your gitian.sigs.ltc are up-to-date if you wish to gverify your builds against other Gitian signatures.

    pushd ./gitian.sigs.ltc
    git pull
    popd

Ensure gitian-builder is up-to-date:

    pushd ./gitian-builder
    git pull
    popd

### Fetch and create inputs: (first time, or when dependency versions change)

    pushd ./gitian-builder
    mkdir -p inputs
    wget -P inputs https://bitcoincore.org/cfields/osslsigncode-Backports-to-1.7.1.patch
    wget -P inputs http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/osslsigncode/osslsigncode/osslsigncode-1.7.1.tar.gz
    popd

Create the OS X SDK tarball, see the [OS X readme](README_osx.md) for details, and copy it into the inputs directory.

### Optional: Seed the Gitian sources cache and offline git repositories

By default, Gitian will fetch source files as needed. To cache them ahead of time:

    pushd ./gitian-builder
<<<<<<< HEAD
    make -C ../Actinium/depends download SOURCES_PATH=`pwd`/cache/common
=======
    make -C ../litecoin/depends download SOURCES_PATH=`pwd`/cache/common
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16
    popd

Only missing files will be fetched, so this is safe to re-run for each build.

NOTE: Offline builds must use the --url flag to ensure Gitian fetches only from local URLs. For example:

    pushd ./gitian-builder
<<<<<<< HEAD
    ./bin/gbuild --url Actinium=/path/to/Actinium,signature=/path/to/sigs {rest of arguments}
=======
    ./bin/gbuild --url litecoin=/path/to/litecoin,signature=/path/to/sigs {rest of arguments}
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16
    popd

The gbuild invocations below <b>DO NOT DO THIS</b> by default.

<<<<<<< HEAD

### Verify other gitian builders signatures to your own. (Optional)

Add other gitian builders keys to your gpg keyring, and/or refresh keys.

<<<<<<< HEAD
    gpg --import Actinium/contrib/gitian-keys/*.pgp
=======
    gpg --import litecoin/contrib/gitian-keys/*.pgp
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16
    gpg --refresh-keys

Verify the signatures

    pushd ./gitian-builder
<<<<<<< HEAD
    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs.ltc/ -r ${VERSION}-linux ../Actinium/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml
    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs.ltc/ -r ${VERSION}-win-unsigned ../Actinium/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win.yml
    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs.ltc/ -r ${VERSION}-osx-unsigned ../Actinium/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
=======
    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs.ltc/ -r ${VERSION}-linux ../litecoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-linux.yml
    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs.ltc/ -r ${VERSION}-win-unsigned ../litecoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win.yml
    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs.ltc/ -r ${VERSION}-osx-unsigned ../litecoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-osx.yml
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16
    popd

### Next steps:

Commit your signature to gitian.sigs.ltc:

    pushd gitian.sigs.ltc
    git add ${VERSION}-linux/${SIGNER}
    git add ${VERSION}-win-unsigned/${SIGNER}
    git add ${VERSION}-osx-unsigned/${SIGNER}
    git commit -a
    git push  # Assuming you can push to the gitian.sigs.ltc tree
    popd

Codesigner only: Create Windows/OS X detached signatures:
- Only one person handles codesigning. Everyone else should skip to the next step.
- Only once the Windows/OS X builds each have 3 matching signatures may they be signed with their respective release keys.

Codesigner only: Sign the osx binary:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    transfer Actinium-osx-unsigned.tar.gz to osx for signing
    tar xf Actinium-osx-unsigned.tar.gz
=======
    transfer litecoin-osx-unsigned.tar.gz to osx for signing
    tar xf litecoin-osx-unsigned.tar.gz
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16
    ./detached-sig-create.sh -s "Key ID"
    Enter the keychain password and authorize the signature
    Move signature-osx.tar.gz back to the gitian host

Codesigner only: Sign the windows binaries:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    tar xf Actinium-win-unsigned.tar.gz
=======
    tar xf litecoin-win-unsigned.tar.gz
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16
    ./detached-sig-create.sh -key /path/to/codesign.key
    Enter the passphrase for the key when prompted
    signature-win.tar.gz will be created

Codesigner only: Commit the detached codesign payloads:

<<<<<<< HEAD
    cd ~/Actinium-detached-sigs
=======
    cd ~/litecoin-detached-sigs
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16
    checkout the appropriate branch for this release series
    rm -rf *
    tar xf signature-osx.tar.gz
    tar xf signature-win.tar.gz
    git add -a
    git commit -m "point to ${VERSION}"
    git tag -s v${VERSION} HEAD
    git push the current branch and new tag

Non-codesigners: wait for Windows/OS X detached signatures:

- Once the Windows/OS X builds each have 3 matching signatures, they will be signed with their respective release keys.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Detached signatures will then be committed to the [Actinium-detached-sigs](https://github.com/Actinium-project/Actinium-detached-sigs) repository, which can be combined with the unsigned apps to create signed binaries.

    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs.ltc/ -r ${VERSION}-win-signed ../Actinium/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml
    mv build/out/Actinium-*win64-setup.exe ../Actinium-${VERSION}-win64-setup.exe
    mv build/out/Actinium-*win32-setup.exe ../Actinium-${VERSION}-win32-setup.exe

    ./bin/gsign --signer $SIGNER --release ${VERSION}-win-signed --destination ../gitian.sigs.ltc/ ../litecoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml
    ./bin/gverify -v -d ../gitian.sigs.ltc/ -r ${VERSION}-win-signed ../litecoin/contrib/gitian-descriptors/gitian-win-signer.yml
    mv build/out/litecoin-*win64-setup.exe ../litecoin-${VERSION}-win64-setup.exe
    mv build/out/litecoin-*win32-setup.exe ../litecoin-${VERSION}-win32-setup.exe
>>>>>>> upstream/0.16
    popd

Commit your signature for the signed OS X/Windows binaries:

    pushd gitian.sigs.ltc
    git add ${VERSION}-osx-signed/${SIGNER}
    git add ${VERSION}-win-signed/${SIGNER}
    git commit -a
    git push  # Assuming you can push to the gitian.sigs.ltc tree
    popd

### After 3 or more people have gitian-built and their results match:

- Create `SHA256SUMS.asc` for the builds, and GPG-sign it:

```bash
sha256sum * > SHA256SUMS
```

The list of files should be:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
Actinium-${VERSION}-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz
Actinium-${VERSION}-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz
Actinium-${VERSION}-i686-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz

```
The `*-debug*` files generated by the gitian build contain debug symbols
for troubleshooting by developers. It is assumed that anyone that is interested
in debugging can run gitian to generate the files for themselves. To avoid
end-user confusion about which file to pick, as well as save storage
<<<<<<< HEAD
space *do not upload these to the Actinium.org server, nor put them in the torrent*.
=======

- GPG-sign it, delete the unsigned file:
```
gpg --digest-algo sha256 --clearsign SHA256SUMS # outputs SHA256SUMS.asc
rm SHA256SUMS
```
(the digest algorithm is forced to sha256 to avoid confusion of the `Hash:` header that GPG adds with the SHA256 used for the files)
Note: check that SHA256SUMS itself doesn't end up in SHA256SUMS, which is a spurious/nonsensical entry.
